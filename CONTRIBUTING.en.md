# Contributing

[🇩🇪 Deutsch](CONTRIBUTING.md) | [🇬🇧 English](CONTRIBUTING.en.md)

Thanks for your interest! This is a hobby project maintained in spare time.

**Please open an [issue](../../issues) first** before submitting a pull request — this way we can discuss whether and how a change should be implemented before you invest your time.

Feedback and ideas in issues are very welcome.

## Bilingual documentation

README, CHANGELOG and CONTRIBUTING always exist in DE + EN. Changes must be submitted in **both language versions simultaneously**.

A pre-commit hook enforces this automatically:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The hook blocks commits where only one language version was changed.
